Parts:
  1 @ Arduino Pro Micro or similar
      (Code may need some adjustment if using a different board.
       Some boards cannot natively act as a keyboard.)
  1 @ ADXL335 Accelerometer breakout board or similar
      (Code is written for the ADXL335, but another two or three axis
       accelerometer should work.)

  1 @ Jumper
  1 @ Micro USB cable
